# Basics of AI

Artificial Intelligence can be divided into several subfields, including:

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. Key concepts include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. They are a key technology in deep learning.

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a valuable way.
